# AI portion

- The ai portion quantifies what I know and puts it into relativistic terms compared with what the company is offering.
- It also writes a tailored resume
- It explains that there may be caveats to this because it is an AI and not actually Ike Maldonado
- Any unethical boasting is not Ike's fault but the AI's

## to the ai
- describe what type of person I am
- describe what type of job I'm looking for (high pay, creative, not stressful)
- describe what I am looking for in terms of salary, without giving my highground away to hr

# Goals for this project
- Be transparent (but not undersell me)
  - use of blooms taxonomy
  - I am remote and work from other countries
- Communicate and provide them a way to reach out to me inside and outside of indeed/ziprecruiter
- provide a social way of showing what's wrong with our system
